FROM Amazon
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name,
    ROUND(SUM(total_amount), 2) AS total_sales,
    ROUND(AVG(discount), 2) AS avg_discount
FROM amazon
GROUP BY product_id, product_name
HAVING
    SUM(total_amount) >
        (SELECT AVG(total_amount) FROM amazon)
    AND
    AVG(discount) <
        (SELECT AVG(discount) FROM amazon)
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
